# burger

## Description

This project makes use of Node, Express, MySQL, and a built-in ORM to create a database of burgers that users
can read, update, and insert new data into. It is deployed on Heroku.

## Notes:

* Overall, this was one of the more challenging assignments for me. I spent a lot of time getting the various 
configurations set up. When I was ready to test, I had trouble with the "method override" package I was using 
to make the PUT method work for the SQL update. I ended up finding some helfpul resources (like this one: https://philipm.at/2017/method-override_in_expressjs.html). 

* As the complexity of my programs increases, I find that I'm spending more time finding resources outside of class and reading documentation in order to understand what's going on. After this HW I plan to do some more reading on PUT vs. POST methods. 

* I really liked learning to run SQL commands from the terminal.
